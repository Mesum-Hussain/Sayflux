# Whistleflux for Android

A voice keyboard that opens on a big mic: tap it, speak, tap the pill, and your words are
typed into whatever app you're in. The keyboard button switches to a Gboard-style QWERTY
(swipe typing, suggestions that learn on the phone, symbols, emoji with search, clipboard).

Speech is recognized on the phone with Cactus Whistle (17 MB), the same model as the
desktop app, which ships inside the app (no download after installing). The text then gets
the same basic clean-up as on desktop, and optionally Gemini's smart clean-up (only the
text is sent, never audio).

The setup screen is React Native. The keyboard, recording, speech model and clean-up are
native Kotlin, because Android keyboards must be native services.

## Build and run

Needs Node 22+, JDK 17 and the Android SDK (platform 37, build-tools 37.0.0,
NDK 27.1.12297006, CMake 3.22.1), with `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME` set.

1. On the phone, turn on **Developer options** (tap *Build number* 7 times in
   *Settings → About phone*), then **USB debugging**. Plug it in and accept the prompt.
2. Check it's visible: `adb devices`
3. Install and run:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm start          # JavaScript dev server; leave it running
   npm run android    # in a second terminal: builds and installs the app
   ```

   This debug build loads its screen from the dev server, so it only opens while
   `npm start` is running and the phone is connected. To install a copy that works on
   its own (about 35 MB, signed with the debug key):

   ```sh
   cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
   adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```

The first build downloads Cactus's speech engine (2 MB) into `android/app/libs/`, and the
speech model (17 MB) and AOSP's English word list (0.9 MB) into `android/.speech-model/`,
all checked against their SHA-256.

The app is built for 64-bit ARM phones only (`reactNativeArchitectures` in
`android/gradle.properties`). Cactus only publishes the speech engine for arm64, so the
app doesn't run on x86_64 emulators.

## Tests

```sh
npm test           # setup screen renders
cd android && ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest   # clean-up matches shared/cleanup-cases.json
npx tsc --noEmit   # type check
```

On a connected phone, the speech engine test transcribes a short clip through the JNI
bridge. Install with `adb install -r` rather than `connectedAndroidTest`, which uninstalls
the app (and its settings) afterwards:

```sh
cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk
adb shell am instrument -w app.whistleflux.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
```
